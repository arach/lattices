# lattices

The agentic window manager for macOS.

Tile windows with hotkeys, manage persistent tmux sessions, index screen
text with OCR, and give AI agents a 35-method desktop API — all from a
native menu bar app and CLI.

## Install

### Download the app

Grab the signed DMG from the [latest release](https://github.com/arach/lattices/releases/latest):

```sh
# Or direct download:
curl -LO https://github.com/arach/lattices/releases/latest/download/Lattices.dmg
open Lattices.dmg
```

Drag **Lattices.app** into Applications. On first launch, a setup wizard
walks you through granting Accessibility, Screen Recording, and choosing
your project directory.

### Install the CLI

```sh
npm install -g @lattices/cli
```

The CLI and app work independently — use either or both.

### Build from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/arach/lattices.git
cd lattices

# Build the menu bar app (requires Swift 6.2 / Xcode 26+)
cd app && swift build -c release && cd ..

# Install CLI dependencies
npm install

# Launch
bun bin/lattices-app.ts build    # bundle the .app
bun bin/lattices-app.ts          # launch it
```

To build a signed, notarized DMG for distribution:

```sh
# Requires a Developer ID certificate and notarytool keychain profile
./tools/release/build-dmg.sh

# Update v<package.json version> and upload the DMG to GitHub Releases
./tools/release/ship.sh
```

## Quick start

```sh
# Launch the menu bar app
lattices app

# Open the command palette from anywhere
# Cmd+Shift+M
```

## Persistent terminal sessions

Declare your dev environment in a `.lattices.json`: which panes, which
commands, what layout. Lattices builds it, runs it, and keeps it alive.
Close your laptop, reboot, come back a week later — your editor, dev
server, and test runner are exactly where you left them.

```sh
cd my-project && lattices start
```

No config? It opens a shell in the project and, when it can, starts your
detected dev command in a second pane.

### Configuration

Drop a `.lattices.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "ensure": true,
  "panes": [
    { "name": "shell", "size": 60 },
    { "name": "server", "cmd": "pnpm dev" },
    { "name": "tests",  "cmd": "pnpm test --watch" }
  ]
}
```

### Layouts

```
2 panes              3+ panes

┌──────────┬───────┐ ┌──────────┬───────┐
│  shell   │server │ │  shell   │server │
│  (60%)   │(40%)  │ │  (60%)   ├───────┤
└──────────┴───────┘ │          │tests  │
                     └──────────┴───────┘
```

### Workspace layers

Group projects into switchable contexts. `Cmd+Option+1` tiles your
frontend and API side by side. `Cmd+Option+2` for the mobile stack.
Sessions stay alive across switches.

### Tab groups

Bundle related repos as tabs in one session. Each tab gets its own
pane layout from its `.lattices.json`.

```sh
lattices group vox         # Launch iOS, macOS, Web, API as tabs
lattices tab vox iOS       # Switch to the iOS tab
```

## Window tiling and awareness

A native menu bar app tracks every window across all your monitors.
Tile with hotkeys, organize into switchable layers, snap to grids.

It reads your windows too — extracting text from UI elements every
60 seconds and running Vision OCR on background windows every 2 hours.
Everything is searchable.

```sh
lattices scan                  # View current screen text
lattices scan search "error"   # Search across all indexed text
lattices scan recent           # Browse scan history
lattices scan deep             # Trigger a Vision OCR scan now
```

## Voice commands (beta)

Speak to control your workspace — tile windows, search, focus apps,
and launch projects with natural language. Powered by
[Vox](https://github.com/arach/vox) for transcription and
local NLEmbedding for intent matching, with Claude fallback for
ambiguous commands.

Trigger with `Hyper+3` (configurable). Press Space to speak, Space to
stop. The panel shows what was heard, the matched intent, extracted
parameters, and execution results.

## A programmable desktop

The menu bar app runs a daemon with 35 RPC methods and 5 real-time
events over WebSocket. Anything you can do from the app, an agent or
script can do over the API.

```js
import { daemonCall } from '@lattices/cli/daemon-client'

// Search windows by content — title, app, session tags, OCR
const results = await daemonCall('windows.search', { query: 'myproject' })

// Launch and tile
await daemonCall('session.launch', { path: '/Users/you/dev/frontend' })
await daemonCall('window.tile', { session: 'frontend-a1b2c3', position: 'left' })

// Read the screen
await daemonCall('ocr.scan')
const errors = await daemonCall('ocr.search', { query: 'error OR failed' })
```

Or from the CLI:

```sh
lattices search myproject           # Find windows by content
lattices search myproject --deep    # Include terminal tab/process data
lattices place myproject left       # Search + focus + tile in one step
```

Claude Code skills, MCP servers, or your own scripts can drive your
desktop the same way you do.
