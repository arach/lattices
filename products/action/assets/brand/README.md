# Action's mark

A sharp capital A whose right foot is taken by a cursor. The cursor's tip sits
on the lower right corner of the counter and its tail runs out through the leg.
The letter is cut back from both of the cursor's arms by an even gap, so the
cursor reads as working inside the letter rather than lying on top of it.

## Where it comes from

`ActionMark` in `apps/site/src/components/ActionMark.tsx` is the source of
truth: the construction drawing approved as STUDY 02 in PR #121. The site's
brand exporter renders everything on disk from it, and the app ports its
numbers to draw the mark live:

| Surface | Drawn by | Colour source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Logo kit (`apps/site/public/brand/action/`) | `apps/site/scripts/export-brand.tsx` | baked, see below |
| App icon (`Action.icns`) | `apps/site/scripts/export-brand.tsx` | baked |
| In-app brand chip | `ActionBrandTile` in `Sources/ActionBrandMarkView.swift` | live theme, kit cursor |
| Menu bar status item | `ActionBrandMark.statusItemImage(live:)` | template, or coral |

`native/engine/CoreSources/ActionBrandMark.swift` is the port. It copies the
component's coordinates and cuts the counter and the cursor's clearance as real
path subtractions, so one path fills identically in CoreGraphics, in an
`NSImage`, and in a SwiftUI `Shape`. It places the glyph on the tile the way
the exporter does, at 66% of the tile and lifted 1.2%, so the chip in a header
and the icon in the Dock are one mark. Change the component first, then carry
the numbers across by hand.

## Colour

| Role | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Paper (tile) | `#f4efe6` |
| Tile foot wash | `#dccfb9` at 45% |
| Ink (letter) | `#19282a` |
| Cursor | `#c58a70` |
| Live (status item only) | coral `#EF6A47` |

The kit keeps the cursor `#c58a70` on both its light and its dark paper, and
the in-app chip does the same. The chip's tile and letter read `StageHUDTheme`
instead, so they follow a theme switch. An `.icns` cannot, which is the one
place the two are allowed to differ.

The theme's coral keeps meaning runtime truth — a recording, a drive holding
the machine — so the resting mark never uses it.

## Menu bar

At rest the status item is a **template** image: the system tints it for the
current appearance and inverts it on highlight, like every other extra. While a
drive holds the machine it is drawn in coral instead — the same thing coral means
everywhere else. A template image cannot carry colour, so the live variant gives
up template tinting; a coral mark is legible against both a light and a dark bar.

The status item widens the gap between the letter and the cursor from the kit's
10 units to 36. Drawn in one colour, the gap is all that separates the two, and
with a 14 pt glyph ten units come to about a quarter of a point, so the cursor
fuses into the leg. Thirty-six open it to about a point.

Liveness comes from `ActionSupervisionRegistry.activeRegistrations()`, polled
every two seconds. It is polled rather than watched because a lease can lapse by
running past its TTL, and an expiry writes nothing a file-system watcher sees.

## Regenerating the icon

```sh
cd apps/site && bun run brand action
# or, from this product:
native/engine/scripts/build-app-icon.sh
```

Writes `Action.icns` plus `action-icon-512.png` and `action-icon-1024.png` here,
and the logo kit in `apps/site/public/brand/action/`. Commit the result —
`build-app.sh` copies the `.icns`, it does not build it, so an ordinary app
build stays fast and offline.

## Earlier work

The app's first mark was a play triangle breaking out of four capture-corner
marks: the frame Action puts around a region, and the take. An earlier round had
drawn a capital A with the play triangle as its counter, and it was rejected as
too on the nose — a letter A for an app called Action says the name, not the
job. PR #121 brought the A back, this time with a cursor, for the site and the
logo kit. The app now follows the kit, so the Dock, the menu bar and
lattices.dev carry one mark.

`explorations/` holds the first round of mark studies. `02-stage-frame.svg` is
the corner-marks mark's ancestor — viewport corner brackets around a play
triangle, with a coral record dot. `01-capture-a.svg` is the first letter-A
study. `landing/` holds the landing-page art and its palette.
