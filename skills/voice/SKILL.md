description: The Lattices voice domain. Use when speaking out loud to the user (voice.say, stop, list, select), simulating a voice command, listing voice intents, checking the voice runtime, or turning spoken window management into the same canonical mutations as the lattices skill.
compatibility: Requires macOS with the Lattices menu bar app running. Voice live session is ws://127.0.0.1:9398.

# Voice

The `voice` domain covers both directions. Listening (spoken commands) runs in
the Lattices daemon. Speaking runs in the Voice helper, which is embedded in
Lattices.app.

Lattices hosts an in-process voice runtime. Spoken commands are another client of the
same execution layer as the CLI and daemon. Spoken commands must resolve
into the same canonical mutations as the `lattices` skill
(`windows.place`, `layers.activate`, `spaces.optimize`).

When this skill is invoked, run the command. Summarize the matched intent
and the result. Do not invent intent names or slot values.

## Prerequisite

```bash
lats voice status
```

If the daemon is down, start it with `lats app`. Voice lives on
`ws://127.0.0.1:9398`. The agent API stays on `9399`.

Capability file:

`~/Library/Application Support/Lattices/Voice/hudson-voice-runtime.json`

Override the voice port only for tests with `LATTICES_VOICE_PORT`.

## Speaking

```bash
lats voice say "Build finished"
lats voice stop              # stop speaking and clear the queue
lats voice list              # voices, with availability
lats voice select <id>       # default voice for later say calls
```

`voice.say` returns once the job is queued, not when speech ends. If the
Voice helper is missing, calls fail with `helper_not_installed`; install it
from Lattices › Apps. If it is installed but not running, they fail with
`helper_unreachable`; open Voice from Lattices › Apps. There is no fallback.

## Agent surface

Agents do not hold the microphone. They simulate speech through the CLI:

```bash
lats voice intents
lats voice simulate "tile this left"
lats voice simulate "focus chrome" --dry-run
```

`lats voice stopListening` stops capture. `lats voice stop` stops
speaking (the Voice helper's output), not listening.

`--dry-run` parses and does not execute. Read `lats voice intents`
before sending a novel phrase.

Equivalent daemon calls:

```bash
lats call voice.status
lats call voice.simulate '{"text":"tile this left","execute":true}'
lats call intents.list
lats call intents.run '{"intent":"tile_window","slots":{"position":"left"},"rawText":"put this on the left","source":"agent"}'
```

## What people say

Humans open the voice window with **Hyper+D**, hold **Option** to talk,
and release to stop.

| Phrase | Result |
| --- | --- |
| "Tile this left" | `windows.place` left |
| "Focus Safari" | Focus that app |
| "Find all vox windows" | Search |
| "Launch the vox project" | Session launch |
| "Switch to layer 2" | `layers.activate` |
| "Scan the screen" | OCR scan |
| "List all windows" | Window list |

Category words such as "terminals", "browsers", and "editors" expand to
real app names before search.

## Policy

- Local intent matching runs first. Provider-backed interpretation is
  optional (Settings > Voice).
- Do not skip the local matcher and send every phrase to an LLM.
- Voice search uses the same backend as `lats search`.
- Keep `wid` in structured actions. In speech the user says an app name;
  the JSON action uses the window id from a snapshot.
- Advisor learning, when a suggestion is used after a local miss, is
  appended to `~/.lattices/advisor-learning.jsonl`.
