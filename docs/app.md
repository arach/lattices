The lattices menu bar app sits in your menu bar and controls your
workspace from there.

## Installation

```bash
lattices app          # Build (or download) and launch
lattices app install  # Register launch-at-login and launch now
lattices app update   # Download the latest release and relaunch
lattices app build    # Rebuild from source
lattices app restart  # Quit, rebuild, relaunch
lattices app quit     # Stop the app
```

The first run builds from source if Swift is available, otherwise
downloads a pre-built binary from GitHub releases.

Use `lattices app install` when you want the companion to start now and
open automatically at login. It installs a user LaunchAgent in
`~/Library/LaunchAgents`; inspect it with `lattices app login status`
and remove it with `lattices app login disable`.

## Command palette

Press **Cmd+Shift+M** from anywhere to open the command palette.
It's a searchable list of every action the app can perform, with
fuzzy matching on titles and subtitles.

## Overlay actors and HUDs

Persistent overlay actors can be hidden or restored with **Hyper+B**. Apps can
publish a static hover dashboard by exposing:

```txt
.lattices/hud/manifest.json
```

Register and publish one:

```bash
lattices hud register .lattices/hud/manifest.json --publish
```

The manifest points to a local `index.html`, optional icon, app activation
target, HUD dimensions, and optional app-owned `sources` metadata for logs or
state files. Lattices hosts the actor and loads the dashboard through a
transparent `WKWebView`; the app owns the renderer and writes its own logs in
the places it already uses.

## Project discovery

The app scans a configurable root directory (up to 3 levels deep)
for `.lattices.json` files. It skips `.git/` and `node_modules/`.

Auto-detection for the scan root checks these paths in order:
`~/dev`, `~/Developer`, `~/projects`, `~/src`.

For each project found, the app reads:
- Pane names and commands from `.lattices.json`
- Dev command and package manager from `package.json`
- Running status by checking `tmux has-session`

## Session management

The app calls the lattices CLI for session operations. Launch runs
`lattices start` in the project directory, Sync runs `lattices sync` to
reconcile panes, and Restart runs `lattices restart <pane>` to kill
and re-run a pane's process. Detach and Kill call `tmux detach-client`
and `tmux kill-session` directly.

## Window tiling

The app can tile terminal windows to preset screen positions via
the command palette. It finds windows by their `[lattices:session-name]`
title tag.

For Terminal.app and iTerm2, tiling uses AppleScript to set window
bounds by matching the title tag. For other terminals, it tiles the
frontmost window.

### Tile positions (app)

| Position     | Area                            |
|--------------|---------------------------------|
| Left         | Left half                       |
| Right        | Right half                      |
| Top Left     | Top-left quarter                |
| Top Right    | Top-right quarter               |
| Bottom Left  | Bottom-left quarter             |
| Bottom Right | Bottom-right quarter            |
| Maximize     | Full visible screen             |
| Left Third   | Left third                      |
| Center Third | Center third                    |
| Right Third  | Right third                     |
| Center       | 80% width, 80% height, centered (20% margin all sides) |

## Moving windows between monitors

Window movement is a right-click action wherever a window is listed.
Both surfaces share one movement engine — the same canonical
`window.move` / `window.place` semantics the CLI and daemon API use —
so moving from the app, the CLI, or the API always behaves identically.

Right-click a window in either surface:

- **Desktop Inventory** — window rows in the inventory list.
- **Studio** — window shapes on the canvas and window rows in the
  sidebar (both the visible-windows list and the layer trees).

The menu offers, top to bottom:

- **Move to Next Monitor** — one click; cycles deterministically
  through the display topology and wraps. The window keeps its
  normalized position and size on the target display's visible frame,
  clamped to fit.
- **Move to Monitor** — submenu listing each display by name; the
  current display is checked and disabled.
- **Move & Place** — single-window only; pick an exact display, then a
  canonical slot (maximize, center, halves, quarters, thirds).

Right-clicking a member of a multi-selection moves the whole selection
("Move 3 Windows to Next Monitor"); each window keeps its own
normalized frame, so selections never collapse into one slot. Move &
Place is omitted for multi-selections because a single slot would
stack the windows. On a single-display machine the movement section
disappears entirely.

Moves happen immediately — no dialog. A short flash reports the
truthful outcome (moved, partially moved, unverified, or blocked on
the Accessibility permission), and the list or canvas refreshes with
the selection preserved.

## Space navigation

"Go to" commands can switch macOS Spaces to reach a window on a
different desktop. The app uses a three-path fallback:

1. **CGWindowList** (needs Screen Recording) — looks up the window
   by title tag, finds its Space via SkyLight, switches to it, then
   raises the window
2. **Accessibility API** (needs Accessibility) — finds the window
   via AXUIElement, raises it, and activates the app
3. **AppleScript** — iterates windows by name for Terminal/iTerm2,
   or bare-activates for other terminals

When a window is found and focused, the app flashes a green border
highlight around it for ~1 second so you can spot it immediately.

Grant Screen Recording and Accessibility permissions in System
Settings > Privacy & Security for all three paths to work.

## Voice commands

> See [Voice Commands](/docs/voice) for the full guide.

Press **Hyper+D** to open the voice command window. Hold **Option** to
speak, release to stop. Lattices transcribes via Vox, matches to an
intent, and executes. Built-in commands: find, show, open, tile, kill, scan.

The provider-backed assistant can run in parallel, offering follow-up
suggestions in the AI corner. Configure the provider and credentials in
Settings > Voice. Workspace chat itself uses Scout and needs no separate key.

## Settings

Open via the command palette or the gear icon in the main view.
The settings window has five tabs:

### General

| Setting    | Description                                          |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Terminal   | Which terminal to use (auto-detected from installed) |
| Mode       | `learning` or `auto` (see below)                     |
| Scan Root  | Directory to scan for .lattices.json configs (type a path or click Browse) |
| Updates    | Download the latest release and relaunch the app     |
| Keyboard Remaps | Optional Caps Lock layer that maps hold to Hyper and tap to Escape |

**Mode** controls how the app handles session interaction:

- **Learning** — shows tmux keybinding hints when you detach
  (helpful while getting used to tmux)
- **Auto** — detaches sessions automatically (fewer prompts)

### Keyboard Remaps

**Keyboard remaps** are enabled by default for the laptop-friendly rule:

- hold Caps Lock -> Hyper (`Control` + `Option` + `Shift` + `Command`)
- tap Caps Lock -> Escape

Rules live in `~/.lattices/keyboard-remaps.json`, and the Settings toggle
can turn the layer off. Keyboard remaps require Accessibility permission
because they use a local event tap.

### Companion

Shows the secure local bridge status, Mac bridge fingerprint, supported
capability grants, and paired iPad or iPhone devices. The paired-device
list shows each device fingerprint, last-seen time, and granted
capabilities. You can refresh the list, revoke an individual device, or
forget all trusted companions.

The local companion bridge and trackpad proxy are off by default for
privacy. Turn the bridge on in Settings > Companion, or open
`lattices://companion/enable` to enable the bridge and jump straight to
Companion settings. `lattices://companion/disable` turns it off again.

The trackpad proxy toggle lives here. Paired devices still need the
`input.trackpad` grant before they can send pointer events.

### AI

| Setting              | Default        | Description                              |
|----------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Workspace chat       | Scout          | Uses the existing local Scout broker and keeps a persistent Scout ref; no separate Lattices chat credential |
| Voice provider       | OpenAI         | Optional voice-only HudsonAI provider for interpretation and speech services |
| Provider credentials | Not set        | API-key storage in the macOS Keychain for the selected provider |

Shows assistant readiness and the selected provider's authentication state.

### Shortcuts

Shows keyboard shortcut reference. These are defaults; you can change them
from Settings > Shortcuts.

| Shortcut          | Action              |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Cmd+Shift+M       | Open command palette |
| Hyper+1            | Workspace home       |
| Hyper+L            | Studio / screen map  |
| Hyper+2            | Window bezel         |
| Hyper+3            | HUD                  |
| Ctrl+Cmd+M         | Hands-off mode       |
| Hyper+Space        | Hyperspace window survey |
| Hyper+G            | In-place window tools |
| Hyper+H            | Window navigation hints |
| Hyper+5            | Omni search          |
| Hyper+6            | Cheat sheet          |
| Ctrl+Option+Space  | Command bar          |
| Ctrl+Option+G      | 4x4 grid placement   |
| Ctrl+Option+V      | Fill open 3x2 cell   |
| Ctrl+Option+arrows | Tile halves          |
| Ctrl+Option+1/2/3  | Tile thirds          |
| Cmd+Option+1/2/3  | Switch workspace layer |
| Ctrl+B  D         | Detach from session  |
| Ctrl+B  X         | Kill current pane    |
| Ctrl+B  Left/Right| Move between panes   |
| Ctrl+B  Z         | Zoom pane (toggle)   |
| Ctrl+B  [         | Scroll mode          |

Hyper+L opens Studio; close it with Escape or `q` when the map owns keyboard
focus, or use the window close button. Hyper+3 opens or dismisses the HUD and
its miniature workspace map. The Scattered and Full HUD presets intentionally
retain a faint, non-interactive ambient surface after dismissal. Neither UI is
the read-only terminal [`lattices map`](/docs/workspace-map) command; see that
page for exact side effects, full-teardown steps, and tab-stack cleanup.

### In-place window tools

Press Hyper+G to arrange the real windows on the current desktop without
switching to a thumbnail survey. Hover a real app window to reveal its dashed
**click to select** outline, then click it to add or remove it from the
selection. Selected windows have solid green numbered outlines; the last one
selected is the active target for single-window actions. You can also select
from the **Windows** drawer in the header or use letter hints. The bottom shelf
shows the three-step flow—Select, Arrange, Finish—and groups actions by timing:

- **Fill** expands the active selected window into open space immediately.
- **Grid** moves two or more selected windows into a balanced grid immediately.
- **Swap** exchanges the first two selected windows.
- **Place** stages an exact grid position for the active selected window; it
  applies only when you Keep changes.
- **More** exposes tab groups, layers, quick placements, and Hyperspace.

Grid, Fill, and Swap update the live desktop while Hyper+G remains open. Press
**Keep changes** or Return to accept those live moves and apply staged changes.
Press **Restore** or Escape to discard staged changes and restore the window
frames and stacking order from when Hyper+G opened. Inline **Now** and **Keep**
labels distinguish immediate actions from staged actions before anything moves.

**Snapshot** starts a three-second countdown, captures the complete display
without closing or changing Hyper+G, copies the PNG to the clipboard, and saves
the same image as a Runs artifact. The command-line equivalent is
`lattices capture display [index] --clipboard --delay 3`.

### Docs

Embedded quick reference with glossary, "how it works" steps, and
links to open the full `config.md` and `concepts.md` docs.

## Supported terminals

| Terminal     | Launch | Focus/Attach | Tile by tag |
|--------------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Terminal.app | yes    | yes          | yes         |
| iTerm2       | yes    | yes          | yes         |
| Warp         | yes    | activate     | frontmost   |
| Ghostty      | yes    | activate     | frontmost   |
| Kitty        | yes    | activate     | frontmost   |
| Alacritty    | yes    | activate     | frontmost   |

"yes" means full AppleScript-based window matching by title tag.
"activate" means the app is brought to front but a specific window
can't be targeted. "frontmost" means tiling applies to whatever
window is in front.

## Screen OCR

> See [Screen OCR](/docs/ocr) for full details on configuration, scanning,
> search, and agent usage.

The app reads text from visible windows using Apple's Vision framework
and stores results in a local SQLite database with FTS5 full-text search.
Agents can use this to "see" what's on screen.

### How it works

1. Every 60 seconds, the app captures the top visible windows as images
2. A SHA256 hash detects whether the window content has changed
3. Changed windows are processed through `VNRecognizeTextRequest` (fast mode)
4. Results are stored in `~/.lattices/ocr.db` with full-text indexing
5. Entries older than 3 days are automatically purged

### Desktop Inventory integration

Desktop Inventory and omni search use OCR to find windows by their content —
not just by title or app name. Matching windows can include contextual text
snippets. Hyper+G's optional drawer is a compact roster for the current display;
use Desktop Inventory or omni search when the on-screen text is the target.

### API access

Agents can query OCR data through four API methods:

| Method         | Description                                    |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `ocr.snapshot` | Current OCR results for all visible windows    |
| `ocr.search`   | Full-text search across history (FTS5 syntax)  |
| `ocr.history`  | Timeline of OCR results for a specific window  |
| `ocr.scan`     | Trigger an immediate scan (bypasses timer)     |

```js
import { daemonCall } from '@lattices/cli'

// Find windows showing error messages
const errors = await daemonCall('ocr.search', { query: 'error OR failed' })

// Read what's currently on screen
const snapshot = await daemonCall('ocr.snapshot')
```

More in the [Agent API reference](/docs/api#ocrsnapshot).

### Requirements

- **Screen Recording** permission — required to capture window and display images
- Granted via System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen Recording

## Local loopback services

The menu bar process owns fixed loopback ports (see `LatticesLocalEndpoints`):

| Service | Port | Endpoint |
|---------|------|----------|
| Agent API / daemon | **9399** | `ws://127.0.0.1:9399` |
| Voice runtime (Hudson Voice / Vox) | **9398** | `ws://127.0.0.1:9398` |

Both start automatically when the app launches and stop when the app quits.
Voice does not require an external `voxd` for normal operation.

## Agent API server

The menu bar app runs a WebSocket server on `ws://127.0.0.1:9399`.
It starts automatically when the app launches and stops when the app
quits.

### Checking status

```bash
lattices daemon status
```

Or programmatically:

```js
import { isDaemonRunning, daemonCall } from '@lattices/cli'

if (await isDaemonRunning()) {
  const status = await daemonCall('daemon.status')
  console.log(status) // { uptime, clientCount, version, windowCount, tmuxSessionCount }
}
```

### What it provides

- 35+ RPC methods for reading windows, sessions, projects, spaces, layers,
  processes, terminals, and OCR. Also launching/killing sessions, tiling
  windows, switching layers, and managing tab groups.
- 5 real-time events (`windows.changed`, `tmux.changed`, `processes.changed`,
  `layer.switched`, `ocr.scanComplete`) broadcast to all connected clients.
- Window tracking that monitors the desktop window list and correlates
  windows to lattices sessions via title tags.
- Space awareness, so it knows which macOS Space each window is on.

### Security

The server binds to localhost only (`127.0.0.1:9399`). Not accessible
from the network. No authentication, so any local process can connect.
This is intentional — it's for local automation, not remote access.

Full method list in the [Agent API reference](/docs/api).

## Diagnostics

The diagnostics panel shows a timestamped log of window navigation
attempts, including which path succeeded or failed. Useful for
debugging Screen Recording / Accessibility permission issues.
