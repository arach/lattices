# Browser Identity: Regular Chrome, Action Browsers, Seeded Identities

How Action gives an agent a **browser identity** without taking over your daily
Chrome — and which kind of control you get in each case.

## Three browsers, two kinds of control

When an agent says "I'll open it in Chrome", it can mean one of three things.
They are not interchangeable.

| | What it is | What the agent can do |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Your regular Chrome** | The browser you use all day. Your real profiles (`Default`, `Profile 1` / "Work"), your tabs, history, extensions, and logins. | **Open a URL, and that's it.** `browser_open { mode: "regular" }` is a visible handoff with no DevTools attachment. To make the agent *act* there, use Action's native macOS control: screen capture + accessibility (`action.observe.snapshot`, `action.resolve.target`, `action.act.execute`). |
| **2. An Action browser** | A real, non-headless Chrome that Action owns, on its own user-data-dir under `~/Library/Application Support/Action/ChromeProfiles/`. The default identity `agent-browser` is blank and signed into nothing. | **Full DOM control** over CDP: `browser_snapshot`, `browser_click`, `browser_fill`, `browser_resize`, `browser_screenshot`, `browser_tabs`. |
| **3. An Action browser identity seeded from one of your Chrome profiles** | The same Action-owned Chrome under a name you choose (`work`, `mira`, …), carrying cookies copied from one of your real profiles for an explicit allowlist of domains. | **Full DOM control, on sites you're already signed in to.** |

The tradeoff in one line: **your regular Chrome has your session but only
screen-and-accessibility control; an Action browser has DOM control but starts
as a stranger.** Seeding (option 3) is how you get both.

This is a boundary Action does not try to cross. [Chrome 136 and later ignore
remote-debugging switches for the default personal data
directory](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/remote-debugging-port), and Action
does not attempt to bypass it. Pointing automation at your everyday user-data-dir
would also fight Chrome's directory lock and hand an agent your full history,
extensions, and sessions by accident.

### Picking one

- The user wants to *look* at something in their own browser → **regular**.
- The agent needs to click through a public site → **Action browser**.
- The agent needs to click through a site you're logged into → **seeded identity**.
- The agent needs to act inside your real signed-in session, and cookies aren't
  enough (passkeys, SSO device trust, an extension's state) → **regular Chrome
  plus Action's native observe/act**, not the browser tools.

## The canonical example: seed "Profile 1" into `work`, then drive it

Your Chrome profile *directory* names are `Default`, `Profile 1`, `Profile 2`, …
and are not the display names you see in Chrome's avatar menu. A browser you
call "Work" is usually the `Profile 1` directory. Map them first, then seed.

From an agent, over MCP:

```text
browser_import_cookies { listSourceProfiles: true }
# -> [{ dir: "Default", name: "Personal" }, { dir: "Profile 1", name: "Work" }, ...]

browser_import_cookies { into: "work", source: "Profile 1", domains: ["github.com"] }
# dry run: lists exactly which cookies would be copied

browser_import_cookies { into: "work", source: "Profile 1", domains: ["github.com"], confirm: true }
# writes them into the Action identity `work`

browser_open { url: "https://github.com/notifications", profile: "work" }
browser_snapshot
browser_screenshot
```

The same thing from the terminal:

```bash
# map display names to profile directories
bun run chrome:companion:import:cookies -- --list-profiles

# dry run
bun run chrome:companion:import:cookies -- list --into work --source "Profile 1" --domains github.com

# write
bun run chrome:companion:import:cookies -- import --into work --source "Profile 1" --domains github.com --confirm
```

After that, `work` is an ordinary Action identity: `browser_use_profile
{ profile: "work" }` or `browser_open { url, profile: "work" }`, and every DOM
tool works against it.

## Named identities

Identities are created on first use — any unused name gives you a fresh blank
one. Shipped conventions:

- `agent-browser` — the default blank agent identity
- `work` — seeded from your work Chrome profile, per the example above
- `mira` — the creative/Midjourney identity used by the companion tooling

Create and prepare one with the companion extension loaded:

```bash
# from repo root
bun run chrome:companion:profile -- setup work
```

This builds the companion extension, creates the profile directory, opens
`chrome://extensions` in that profile, and reveals `packages/chrome-companion/dist`
so you can **Load unpacked** once.

Later:

```bash
bun run chrome:companion:profile -- launch work
bun run chrome:companion:profile -- check work
bun run chrome:companion:profile -- path work
```

Environment aliases (shared between companion tooling and Action Browser MCP):

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `ACTION_BROWSER_PROFILE` / `ACTION_CHROME_COMPANION_PROFILE` | Active identity name |
| `ACTION_BROWSER_PROFILE_DIR` / `ACTION_CHROME_COMPANION_PROFILE_DIR` | Absolute user-data-dir override |
| `ACTION_BROWSER_PROFILE_ROOT` / `ACTION_CHROME_COMPANION_PROFILE_ROOT` | Root for named identities |
| `ACTION_BROWSER_DEBUG_PORT` | CDP port (MCP default `9334`) |
| `ACTION_ROOT` | Monorepo root (needed for cookie tools when MCP is not cwd-rooted) |

## Cookie seeding

Copy **selected** cookies from a regular Chrome profile into an Action identity:

```bash
# list your Chrome profiles (directory + display name)
bun run chrome:companion:import:cookies -- --list-profiles

# list Action identities
bun run chrome:companion:import:cookies -- --list-action-profiles

# dry-run
bun run chrome:companion:import:cookies -- list --into work --domains github.com

# write
bun run chrome:companion:import:cookies -- import --into work --domains github.com --confirm

# narrow to specific cookies
bun run chrome:companion:import:cookies -- import --into mira \
  --domains midjourney.com \
  --only cf_clearance \
  --confirm
```

Or via the profile CLI:

```bash
bun run chrome:companion:profile -- import-cookies import --into work --domains github.com --confirm
```

Notes:

- Requires a Keychain allow for Chrome Safe Storage only when decrypting values;
  the import path copies encrypted blobs as-is for same-machine use.
- Prefer domain allowlists over full-jar dumps.
- Cookies are not a complete identity (localStorage / passkeys may still need a
  one-time interactive login in the Action identity).

## Chrome Companion (generic extension)

Package: `packages/chrome-companion`

- Manifest V3 extension with DOM observe / resolve / act helpers
- Localhost bridge on `http://127.0.0.1:4321` (WebSocket for the extension)
- One-time **Load unpacked** per Action identity (`dist/` after build)

```bash
bun run chrome:companion:build
bun run chrome:companion:bridge
bun run chrome:companion:health
bun run chrome:companion:profile -- setup work
```

Chrome Stable often ignores `--load-extension`; the reliable path is manual
unpacked install inside the Action-owned identity.

## Action Browser MCP

Server: `plugins/action-browser/server/index.ts`

### Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `browser_profiles` | List Action identities, the active one, and the three-surface policy |
| `browser_use_profile` | Switch the active identity (`agent-browser`, `work`, `mira`, …) |
| `browser_profile_info` | Active path, cookie readiness, companion hints |
| `browser_import_cookies` | Dry-run or confirm a seed from a regular Chrome profile |
| `browser_companion_status` | Extension dist + bridge health |
| `browser_open` | Open in an Action browser, or `mode: "regular"` for an open-only handoff |
| `browser_tabs` / `browser_snapshot` / `browser_click` / `browser_fill` / `browser_screenshot` / `browser_close` | DOM automation via CDP — Action browsers only |
| `browser_resize` | Set a tab to an explicit viewport width and height for responsive checks; `target: "window"` resizes the real Chrome window instead |

### Two MCP surfaces

- **Native runtime MCP** (`action`): observe / resolve / act / record on macOS
  through Action.app. This is what controls your *regular* Chrome window, and
  every other native app, via screen capture and accessibility.
- **Browser MCP** (`action-browser` plugin): Action-owned Chrome identities plus
  DOM-level tools over CDP.

Install the browser plugin from the marketplace:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add arach/action
claude plugin install action-browser@action --scope user
```

Or point Claude at the local server with a default identity (replace the paths
with your own checkout and `bun` location):

```bash
claude mcp add action-browser -s user \
  -e ACTION_ROOT="$HOME/dev/action" \
  -e ACTION_BROWSER_PROFILE=work \
  -- "$(which bun)" "$HOME/dev/action/plugins/action-browser/server/index.ts"
```

### Agent workflow

```text
browser_profiles                                   # what identities exist
browser_use_profile { profile: "work" }            # pick one
browser_open { url: "https://github.com" }         # drive it
browser_snapshot
browser_screenshot
browser_companion_status                           # optional richer DOM path
browser_close { scope: "browser" }                 # when the task is done
```

To open a URL in the user's own Chrome instead:

```text
browser_open { url: "https://github.com", mode: "regular" }
```

Regular mode is deliberately not controllable, and the result says so:
`controlAvailable: false`, plus the native control path. Snapshot, click, fill,
and screenshot continue to target the Action browser.

### Responsive breakpoints

`browser_resize` gives an already-open tab an explicit viewport, so a narrow
layout can be captured instead of assumed.

```text
browser_open   { url: "http://localhost:3000" }
browser_resize { width: 1440, height: 900 }
browser_screenshot
browser_resize { width: 390, height: 844, mobile: true, matchMedia: ["(max-width: 767px)"] }
browser_screenshot
browser_resize { reset: true }
```

Two targets, deliberately not interchangeable:

| | What moves | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| `target: "tab"` (default) | CSS emulation for that one tab | Exact to the pixel, other tabs unaffected, fully reversible |
| `target: "window"` | The real Chrome window hosting the tab | Every tab in that window moves, the display is a hard ceiling, and the tab's emulated viewport is dropped first |

A device-metrics override belongs to the CDP session that set it, and Action
Browser opens a fresh session per tool call. Two consequences shape the design:

- The server keeps the requested viewport in memory and re-applies it on every
  session, so a resize survives the later `browser_screenshot` that is the whole
  point of it. It is per-tab, in-memory only, and dropped when the tab or the
  browser closes — nothing is written to the profile.
- `reset` cannot simply call `clearDeviceMetricsOverride`: a foreign session's
  clear is accepted and does nothing, leaving Chrome stuck at the stale size. The
  reset re-sets the metrics to adopt ownership first, then clears them.

`deviceScaleFactor` defaults to `1`, which makes screenshot pixels equal CSS
pixels — a 390-wide viewport returns a 390px-wide PNG. Read `exact` in the reply
before trusting a capture: a page with a hard `min-width` can refuse to lay out
as narrow as it was asked to.

## Plugin versioning

Harnesses cache installed plugin metadata — skills, interface copy, MCP entry —
by version. Bumping one manifest and not the others leaves an install serving
stale tool descriptions, so all of them move together:

```bash
bun run plugin:version              # check that every manifest agrees
bun run plugin:version -- 0.3.0     # set them all
```

Covers `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, the Claude/Codex/Kimi plugin manifests,
and `SERVER_VERSION` in the MCP server. After a bump, reinstall or refresh the
plugin in each harness so the cached copy is replaced.

## What is intentionally not done

- Automation attachment to the currently open regular Chrome window
- Silent full cookie jar import
- Claiming a page is authenticated without observing it after seed/login
