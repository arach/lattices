# Voice

Native macOS speech playback for agents and scripts.

Queue a build result or an agent summary and keep working while Voice reads it
aloud. Voice owns synthesis, the playback queue, and an optional readalong HUD,
so playback continues after the client disconnects. Lattices connects speech
output with its own dictation and spoken-command controls through the `voice`
API domain.

## Install and run

Requires macOS 26+. Kokoro's Neural Engine renderer requires Apple silicon.
Install the Lattices CLI with Bun and start the menu bar app:

```sh
bun add --global @arach/lattices
lattices app
```

In the Lattices **Apps** menu, choose **Voice** to install or open the helper.
Voice has its own process and settings. Quitting Lattices does not quit Voice
or clear its queue.

With Lattices and Voice running:

```sh
lattices voice status
lattices voice list
lattices voice say "Build finished"
lattices voice say "The tests passed" --provider kokoro
```

The default provider is `system`. Kokoro downloads its model and required voice
assets on first use, then renders locally through FluidAudio's `KokoroAne`.
OpenAI and ElevenLabs are also available with credentials configured in Voice
settings. Credentials stay in the macOS Keychain.

## Build from source

Use Bun and a Swift 6.2 toolchain on macOS 26+. SwiftPM fetches Hudson over SSH,
so the build needs access to the Hudson repository named in
[Package.swift](Package.swift). Run these commands from the monorepo root:

```sh
HUDSONKIT_WITH_VOICE=0 swift build --package-path products/voice
HUDSONKIT_WITH_VOICE=0 swift test --package-path products/voice
bash products/voice/tools/package.sh
```

`HUDSONKIT_WITH_VOICE=0` excludes Hudson's dictation dependencies from this
speech-output app. The packaging script sets it from [build.json](build.json)
and produces `products/voice/.artifacts/Voice.app`, with an ad hoc signature by
default. Packaging does not install, launch, notarize, or publish the app.

To run the local artifact, quit any other Voice instance first, then use:

```sh
open products/voice/.artifacts/Voice.app
```

The packaging script refuses to overwrite an existing artifact. Set
`SPEECH_ARTIFACT_DIR` to a new output directory for another build. Real-model
Kokoro tests are opt-in through `VOICE_KOKORO_LIVE=1`; ordinary tests skip those
downloads and renders.

## Use with Lattices

The CLI executable in this checkout is `lattices`. Its `voice` commands call
the core daemon, which forwards speech output to Voice. The helper keeps the
older `speech.*` RPC names and `dev.lattices.Speech` bundle identifier for
compatibility with existing clients.

| Surface | Address | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent API, including `voice.*` | `ws://127.0.0.1:9399` | Lattices core |
| Dictation and live voice sessions | `ws://127.0.0.1:9398` | Lattices core |
| Speech queue and playback, `speech.*` | `ws://127.0.0.1:9397` | Voice helper |

For example, `voice.say` forwards to `speech.enqueue`, and `voice.list`
forwards to `speech.voices`. A successful enqueue returns a job ID and state;
it does not mean playback has finished.

```sh
lattices voice pause
lattices voice resume
lattices voice seek 5
lattices voice skip
lattices voice stop
lattices voice select af_heart --provider kokoro
```

`voice.stop` stops playback and clears the queue. Dictation stays in Lattices:
`lattices voice listen` starts capture, and `lattices voice stopListening`
stops capture and runs the transcript. Voice's Swift package contains the
speech-output runtime, not the microphone runtime.

Direct RPC clients authenticate with the `x-lattices-speech-token` WebSocket
header. Voice creates the token at
`~/Library/Application Support/Speech/RPC/capability` while running; the
Lattices CLI reads and sends it automatically. Output requests report
`helper_not_installed`, `helper_unreachable`, or `helper_unauthorized` when the
helper cannot serve them. Use the Apps menu to install or open Voice, then
retry through the CLI.

This product exposes a WebSocket RPC server. The repository's root MCP server
currently registers browser tools; speech clients use the CLI or RPC described
here.

## Architecture

Paths below are relative to `products/voice/`.

```text
Sources/Speech/       app entry point, settings, HUD, queue, synthesis, RPC
Tests/SpeechTests/    queue, provider, socket, migration, and Kokoro tests
tools/package.sh     local app bundle, signing, and optional DMG packaging
assets/              app icon
Package.swift        Voice executable and Hudson/FluidAudio dependencies
build.json           build features consumed by the packaging script
Info.plist           app identity and minimum macOS version
SOURCE-PROVENANCE.json  imported-source provenance
```

`SpeechQueue.swift` owns job state. `HudsonSpeechRuntime.swift` connects the
queue to Hudson's providers, cache, and audio player. `SpeechKokoroRuntime.swift`
renders Kokoro in-process on the Neural Engine. `SpeechRpc.swift` defines the
API, and `DaemonServer.swift` serves authenticated local connections.
