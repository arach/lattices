      "On Arach's Mac, /Users/arach/dev/action is a compatibility symlink to /Users/arach/dev/lattices/products/action. Both paths share the Lattices Git checkout and its uncommitted work. Verify the Git root and status before changing files.",
      'Read ../../AGENTS.md for Lattices workspace rules before applying these product instructions. Keep Action.app, its local agent, and its recording lifecycle independent from the Lattices menu bar app.',
      'Use bun as the JavaScript package manager for this repo.',
      'Action lives at `products/action/` inside the Lattices monorepo. Run product-local commands from this directory or use the root `action:*` scripts.',
      'The public product page and published Action documentation live at `https://lattices.dev/action`; source links point into `arach/lattices`.',
      'Action releases use `action-vX.Y.Z` tags so they cannot collide with Lattices app tags.',
      'The native product lives in native/engine and builds a signed Action.app bundle.',
      'Action.app owns AppKit lifecycle, menus, WebKit, permissions UX, and the recording probe path.',
      'The local Action agent exposes WebSocket methods and should not own fragile AppKit lifecycle responsibilities directly.',
      'ScreenCaptureKit recording is currently stabilized by launching a fresh Action.app instance in recording-probe mode.',
      'Recording commands should be treated as asynchronous: the initial CLI reply acknowledges startup, while completion is represented by a finished marker file.',
      'The repo still contains older design docs in docs/*.md that describe architecture and product direction beyond the Dewey quickstart set.',
