# The Lattices MCP

One MCP server ships with the `lattices` package. Agent config names the binary,
never a path:

```json
{ "command": "lattices", "args": ["mcp"] }
```

That is the whole point of this document. Everything else is detail.

## Why a subcommand and not a plugin path

Before this, Action Browser was addressed as if it were an independent product
living at a fixed place on disk. Every harness held its own copy of that
assumption, and each one broke differently:

| Harness | What it pointed at | Failure mode |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | marketplace `action` → `installLocation: /Users/art/dev/action` | Directory moved into `lattices/products/action`. The tools were simply **absent** — no error, nothing in `/mcp`. |
| Claude Code (after the first fix) | `.../plugins/cache/action/action-browser/0.3.0/` | A version-pinned copy. The next version bump orphans it. |
| Codex | `.../products/action/plugins/action-browser/scripts/...` | A checkout path. The next repo move breaks it. |

Each of those is the same bug wearing a different hat: **the address of the tools
was a location instead of a name.**

A subcommand fixes it because resolution follows the installed binary. If
`lattices` is on `PATH`, `lattices mcp` is correct — whether that is a global
`bun install -g @arach/lattices`, a `bun link` from a checkout, or a future
Homebrew formula. Moving the repo, bumping the version, and reinstalling all
become no-ops for agent config.

### The runtime still has to be found

Naming the binary moves the problem from "where is the code" to "is the binary on
this process's `PATH`" -- which on macOS is not free. A GUI-launched app inherits
the bare system `PATH` (`/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`), and neither `lattices`
nor `bun` is there:

```console
$ env -i PATH="/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin" sh -c 'command -v lattices || echo missing'
missing
```

The retired `run-action-browser-mcp.sh` knew this -- it hunted for Bun across
`ACTION_BUN_BIN`, `PATH`, and the usual install locations, and its test was
literally named "launcher finds the user Bun with a GUI PATH". Deleting that
script without replacing the behaviour would have traded one silent "the browser
tools are gone" for another.

So `bin/lattices` is a POSIX shell launcher, not a bun-shebanged script. It
resolves through however many symlinks the install put in the way, finds Bun
(`LATTICES_BUN_BIN` → `PATH` → `~/.bun/bin`, Homebrew, `/usr/local`), and execs
`bin/lattices.ts`. A harness that can find `lattices` at all can now run it, and a
machine with no Bun gets a one-line error instead of a failed exec.

Finding `lattices` itself is the part a launcher cannot solve. Claude Code
resolves it (verified: `claude mcp list` reports the server connected). A harness
that spawns with a bare system `PATH` would not, and the fallback there is to name
the install location -- `/Users/<you>/.bun/bin/lattices` -- which is still stable
across repo moves and version bumps, and so is still strictly better than what it
replaced.

### Alternatives considered

- **Point the marketplace at `github: arach/lattices` instead of a local
  directory.** Fixes today's specific breakage, and is genuinely path-free from
  the user's side. Rejected as the primary mechanism because it is Claude
  Code–only: Codex and Kimi would still hold literal paths, and each plugin
  update still writes a fresh version-pinned cache directory.
- **A separate `lattices-mcp` bin entry.** Works, but adds a second published
  binary name to keep in step with the first for no gain over a subcommand.
- **Publishing the MCP as its own npm package.** Reintroduces the thing being
  removed: two products to install, two versions to keep aligned.

## Layout

```
bin/lattices             # POSIX shell launcher: finds Bun, execs the CLI
bin/lattices.ts          # the CLI; `mcp` dispatches into bin/mcp
bin/mcp/
  server.ts              # `lattices mcp` entry: flags, signals, process
  router.ts              # stdio JSON-RPC, tool -> toolset table
  registry.ts            # lazily loaded toolsets
  types.ts               # the Toolset contract
  toolsets/
    browser/             # Action Browser, moved here from products/action
      index.ts
      navigation.ts
      viewport.ts
      transport.ts
```

The server lives under `bin/` because that is what the npm package actually
ships. `package.json#files` lists `bin`; it does not list `products`. A design
that left the server under `products/action/plugins/` and imported it would
typecheck locally and be missing from every real install — so the code moves
rather than being referenced across the boundary. The root `tsconfig.json`
already covers `bin/**/*.ts`, so the browser server is now typechecked by
`bun run check:types`, which it was not before.

## Toolsets

The router owns the protocol; a toolset owns its tools.

```ts
type Toolset = {
  name: string;
  tools: ToolDefinition[];
  init?(): Promise<void>;      // startup work, e.g. sweeping dead-owner claims
  onToolCall?(): void;         // per-call bookkeeping, e.g. the idle timer
  callTool(name, args): Promise<ToolResult>;
  instructions?: string[];
};
```

`init` runs once at startup for every enabled toolset. `onToolCall` fires only
for that toolset's own tools, so a call into one toolset does not reset another's
idle timer.

`lattices mcp --toolsets browser` narrows to a subset; the default is all of
them. `lattices mcp --list` prints the registry without speaking the protocol.

### Tool names are not namespaced

`browser_open`, `browser_screenshot`, `browser_close` and the rest keep their
exact names. They are load-bearing: they appear in the operator's global
`CLAUDE.md` and in standing instructions across three harnesses, and a rename
silently invalidates all of it.

What changes is the *client-side prefix*, which is derived from the server name
and was never stable anyway:

```
mcp__plugin_action-browser_action-browser__browser_open   →   mcp__lattices__browser_open
```

No instruction anywhere refers to the prefixed form, so nothing needs aliasing.
Future toolsets follow the same convention — a short verb-ish prefix per domain
(`browser_*`, and later `window_*`, `session_*`) rather than a product name.

## Lifecycle guarantees

These are the reason Action Browser is written the way it is: orphaned headless
Chromes filled this machine's disk on 2026-07-22. The fold **moves** that code
rather than reimplementing it, and deliberately changes none of its identifiers:

- Ownership claim files in `~/Library/Application Support/Action/BrowserSessions`
- Session names of the form `action-<pid>-<rand>` (`pidFromSessionName` parses
  that prefix, so it is part of the on-disk contract, not cosmetic)
- `ACTION_BROWSER_*` / `ACTION_CHROME_COMPANION_*` environment variables
- CDP port `9334`, profile root `~/Library/Application Support/Action/ChromeProfiles`
- Owner-dies → browser-dies, via `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT`/`SIGHUP` hooks plus a
  synchronous `exit` release
- The 15-minute idle close (`ACTION_BROWSER_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS`)
- Ref-counting across concurrent servers sharing profile + port
- The startup sweep for dead-owner claims

Keeping the claim schema byte-identical has a migration payoff: an old plugin
server still running from the plugin cache and a new `lattices mcp` server
ref-count *each other* correctly. The two can overlap during a rollout without
either one killing a Chrome the other is using.

## What happened to the plugin and the `action` marketplace

**The plugin no longer ships an MCP server.** `.mcp.json`, the `mcpServers`
blocks in the Codex and Kimi manifests, and `scripts/run-action-browser-mcp.sh`
are gone. There is exactly one live path to the browser tools: `lattices mcp`.

Two registrations would have been worse than none. A session with both the
plugin installed *and* `lattices mcp` configured gets `browser_open` twice under
different prefixes, and an agent picking between two identical tools backed by
two separate Chrome-owning processes is a lifecycle problem, not a cosmetic one.

**The plugin survives as a skill carrier.** It still ships
`skills/action-browser/SKILL.md`, and the marketplace is renamed `action` →
`lattices` to match where the code now lives. The split is deliberate:

- The load-bearing part (tools) is addressed by name and cannot be broken by
  moving the repo.
- The nice-to-have part (skill prose) is still installed the plugin way, and if
  *that* ever breaks the failure is an agent with slightly less guidance — not an
  agent with no browser.

That asymmetry is the whole design. The 2026-09-10 outage was bad specifically
because a path failure took out capability. Now a path failure can only take out
documentation.

## Migrating a machine

Claude Code:

```bash
claude plugin uninstall action-browser@action
claude plugin marketplace remove action
claude mcp add lattices -s user -- lattices mcp
# optional, for the skill only:
claude plugin marketplace add arach/lattices
claude plugin install action-browser@lattices --scope user
```

Codex — replace the `[mcp_servers.action-browser]` block in `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.lattices]
command = "lattices"
args = ["mcp"]
```

Kimi:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.kimi-code/plugins/managed/action-browser
```

then add the same `command: "lattices", args: ["mcp"]` entry to its MCP config.

`lattices mcp --print-config <claude|codex|kimi>` emits these snippets so a new
machine does not have to be told twice.

## Verifying

```bash
lattices mcp --list                    # toolsets and tool names, no protocol
bun test tests/mcp.test.ts             # router + toolset contract
```

In a harness: `/mcp` should show `lattices` connected, and `browser_open`
followed by `browser_screenshot` should return a PNG.
