description: Install lattices and launch your first workspace in 2 minutes
order: 0.5

Four steps to a running workspace.

## 1. Install lattices

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arach/lattices
cd lattices && bun link
```

Verify: `lattices help` should print usage info.

## 2. Launch the menu bar app

```bash
lattices app
```

This builds (or downloads) and launches the native macOS companion.
Open the command palette with **Cmd+Shift+M** to search and launch
any project, tile windows, or switch workspace layers.

## 3. Add a project config

Drop a `.lattices.json` in your project root:

```bash
cd ~/your-project
lattices init
```

This generates a config like:

```json
{
  "panes": [
    { "name": "shell", "size": 60 },
    { "name": "server", "cmd": "bun dev" }
  ]
}
```

The menu bar app discovers projects with `.lattices.json` files
automatically — they show up in the command palette.

## 4. (Optional) Add tmux for persistent sessions

If you want terminal sessions that survive disconnects and auto-restore
your pane layout:

```bash
brew install tmux
cd ~/your-project && lattices start
```

This creates a tmux session with your configured panes side by side.
The session persists in the background — close your terminal, reopen it,
run `lattices start` again, and everything is still there.

> **Without tmux**, you still get the menu bar app, command palette,
> window tiling, workspace layers, OCR, and the full agent API.
